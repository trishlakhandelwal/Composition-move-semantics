Part I: Class Design

Each duelingJP object encapsulates some number of distinct jumpPrime objects; the cardinality of jumpPrime subobjects varies across duelingJP objects. The key functionality of a duelingJP object is to manage the jumpPrime subobjects and answer client queries as to the number of ‘collisions’ and ‘inversions’.

Two jumpPrime objects are said to ‘collide’ if they produce the same prime number upon an up (or down) request. 
For example, if active jumpPrime object j1 encapsulates 2222, and jumpPrime object j2 encapsulates 2233, they both will produce 2221 for down()and 2237 for up().

Two jumpPrime objects are said to be ‘inversions’ if they produce the same prime number for complementary requests. For example, if active jumpPrime object j3 encapsulates 3519, and active jumpPrime object j4 encapsulates 3528, j4 produces 3527 for down()and j3 produces 3527 for up().

Deep copying must be supported, and should be explicitly tested in the driver.
Move semantics must be supported, and should be explicitly tested in the driver by the use of smart pointers and an STL container.
Many details are missing. You MUST make and DOCUMENT your design decisions!!

Part II: Driver (p2.cpp) -- External Perspective of Client – tests your class design

Additionally:
1) Do NOT use raw pointers
2) Demonstrate your understanding of smart pointers by using both unique_ptr and shared_ptr instead of raw pointers to reference heap-allocated duelingJP objects
3) Use a container from the STL
   Add and remove heap-allocated duelingJP objects to this container
4) Demonstrate copying of duelingJP objects via call by value
